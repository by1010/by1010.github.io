    <h1>Reading Reflections</h1>

    <p>2/9</p>

While reading On Photography by Susan Sontag , I feel that we as a society take photography for granted because it has the ability to do so many things. As Sontag describes, photography shows evidence, a reality, or a romanticized scenario. The photo is the art of a moment, it describes whatever the person behind the camera wants to show whether it be a ceremonious major life event like a happy couple at a wedding or the horrors of war with bloodied bodies and emaciated children.

We live in an age where social media is extremely prevalent and with that comes the constant need to photograph and video life moments. To me, photography is a way to remember a moment and connect with others. Personally, I don’t consider myself a photographer since I believe photographers are people who take purposeful photos to depict a certain reality. They are trained to have an eye for the most pleasing aesthetic. In contrast, my photos, which are few and far between, are mostly just for convenience such as close ups of notes from a presentation or passwords that I will need to remember later. 

It started in middle school where my classmates began to use social media. I didn't really care for it despite my friends' constant pestering to get me to join. At the time, social media was unnecessary and I just wasn't interested in other people’s lives. Then came high school and everyone was now on social media. People constantly posted photos and updates of their lives, showing where they were or what they were doing at the exact moment. That's when I realised the importance of photography since it was a way to stay connected and updated with people. For example, if a classmate posted a photo of a concert they went to and it was an artist I also liked, I could have a little conversation with them, and then we would come out of it closer than before. I admit I hardly look back on my own photos but it feels nice to have something visual that showed that I did buy and eat an affogato cake earlier or that I had a fun hangout with a friend the other day. 

I would use photography, illustration and a combination of image and text nations to depict the distorted reality that the art world is being plagued by in the current state of the world. With the rise of AI technology, it has become harder and harder to tell if a photo is legitimate or fake. It has become easier to create events that have never happened to slander individuals or groups of people, and the overuse and unnecessary advancements of AI is slowly inching us towards a dystopian society. The epidemic of AI art, specifically, is also a poison to humanity because it is taking jobs and sucking the life of what art is supposed to be. Art is art because it comes from the passion and hard work of real people and not only does AI art look awful but it is a soulless replica of what it is trying to copy. I would like to choose to depict this using various glitchy textures and blurring out faces to show how AI is causing society to lose individuality. I would use several elements that one would normally see in everyday life such as a tree or birds and change the color or morph the element until it looks like a vague form of what it originally was.

Nesrine Malik’s article “With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the
world is sleepwalking into disaster” is an insightful read and introduced new points that I never thought of myself. The fact that AI is inherently conservative because the data it is being trained upon is conservative is something that I will research more about. 

I agree with the article’s overall points about how AI is ruining the trustworthiness of the internet, making it difficult to discern whether something is real or AI. I see examples of this on social media platforms like Youtube or Instagram where their shorts or reels, respectively, are full of AI in every other scroll. I remember seeing an innocent video of some late night backyard camera footage of a coyote jumping on a trampoline, thinking it was real but I later found out it was AI. It is concerning how easy it is to make up these photos or videos that seem extremely realistic and I hate that I have to always read the comments to check if what I am seeing is real or not. 

This reminds me of the dead internet theory which is the idea that the internet will eventually no longer be human driven and will be run by AI instead. That AI will just feed off itself and the internet will be an endless cycle of braindead content. The internet is currently heading into this direction but with news of the AI market not doing well, we can hopefully avoid this future. AI content has already invaded social media, and there are definitely more negatives than positives. There comes the issue of deepfakes, which is putting a real individual in a situation using AI. I have seen many problems with this, especially of putting women into pornographic situations without their consent. The fact that anybody can do this very easily should be scaring more people and this could easily ruin lives. I have seen deepfakes of political figures pulling out the middle finger or dancing weirdly, and it’s insane that the current US administration is also using this technology as a way of putting out statements.

Another issue is how people are using AI chatbots for companionship. This leads to them isolating themselves further while they talk into a void that just repeats back whatever they want. AI like ChatGPT are essentially yesmen and they never go against their user unless explicitly told, so they agree with whatever the person tells them. I have seen stories on the internet where suicidal individuals are goaded into killing themselves or those with homicidal tendencies are also validated by these AIs. Even though these AIs are only code, they have managed to become convincing enough that people think they’re actually developing a relationship with these things. At the end of the day, these relationships are fake and these people's mental healths will get even worse than before they used the bots.

It is important that people stay vigilant about AI because if we keep relying on it, humankind would be set back several steps.
