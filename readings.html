    <h1>Reading Reflections</h1>

    <p>2/9</p>

While reading On Photography by Susan Sontag , I feel that we as a society take photography for granted because it has the ability to do so many things. As Sontag describes, photography shows evidence, a reality, or a romanticized scenario. The photo is the art of a moment, it describes whatever the person behind the camera wants to show whether it be a ceremonious major life event like a happy couple at a wedding or the horrors of war with bloodied bodies and emaciated children.

We live in an age where social media is extremely prevalent and with that comes the constant need to photograph and video life moments. To me, photography is a way to remember a moment and connect with others. Personally, I don’t consider myself a photographer since I believe photographers are people who take purposeful photos to depict a certain reality. They are trained to have an eye for the most pleasing aesthetic. In contrast, my photos, which are few and far between, are mostly just for convenience such as close ups of notes from a presentation or passwords that I will need to remember later. 

It started in middle school where my classmates began to use social media. I didn't really care for it despite my friends' constant pestering to get me to join. At the time, social media was unnecessary and I just wasn't interested in other people’s lives. Then came high school and everyone was now on social media. People constantly posted photos and updates of their lives, showing where they were or what they were doing at the exact moment. That's when I realised the importance of photography since it was a way to stay connected and updated with people. For example, if a classmate posted a photo of a concert they went to and it was an artist I also liked, I could have a little conversation with them, and then we would come out of it closer than before. I admit I hardly look back on my own photos but it feels nice to have something visual that showed that I did buy and eat an affogato cake earlier or that I had a fun hangout with a friend the other day. 

I would use photography, illustration and a combination of image and text nations to depict the distorted reality that the art world is being plagued by in the current state of the world. With the rise of AI technology, it has become harder and harder to tell if a photo is legitimate or fake. It has become easier to create events that have never happened to slander individuals or groups of people, and the overuse and unnecessary advancements of AI is slowly inching us towards a dystopian society. The epidemic of AI art, specifically, is also a poison to humanity because it is taking jobs and sucking the life of what art is supposed to be. Art is art because it comes from the passion and hard work of real people and not only does AI art look awful but it is a soulless replica of what it is trying to copy. I would like to choose to depict this using various glitchy textures and blurring out faces to show how AI is causing society to lose individuality. I would use several elements that one would normally see in everyday life such as a tree or birds and change the color or morph the element until it looks like a vague form of what it originally was.
