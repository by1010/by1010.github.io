    <p>
        I chose this image because I liked that the window frame was visible and that the vanishing point was off frame. I also found the architecture outside visually interesting because there were many lines going into different directions such as the glass bridge going into one building while the outer building was wrapping around the block. 

The original photo came out very blue and reminded me of when movies color grade too heavily such as in Twilight. The quality was also a little blurry and when I messed around with the adjustment settings, I decided to lean into that blurriness. My goal was to make the photo look a fuzzy dream, so I lowered the saturation and upped the dehaze option multiple times. I increased the brightness and lowered the contrast to make the elements blur together and that was how I achieved the look.
