        I chose this photo because I liked the look of the vanishing point in the center of the photo. It looked as if the buildings and cars were bursting out of that one point which made for an interesting visual. 

However, the photo wasn’t straight so I had to fix that after I cropped it to a 5:7 ratio. I wasn’t sure of what I wanted this photo to look like, and at first, I wanted to tone out all of the blue color so I adjusted the yellow hues and green hues higher. Then, I noticed that the sky and the top of the cars reflected the blue heavily so I wanted to make those colors pop. I increased the saturation and added points to the level curve to make the shadows darker and the highlights lighter for even more contrast.
